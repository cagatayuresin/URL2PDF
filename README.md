Wkhtmltopdf has a graphical interface.

Main Window:

Paste the URL you want to get the PDF of, press CONVERT or ENTER.

When you receive a green warning SUCCESS FILE NAME TIME SEAL.pdf. Your file will be waiting for you inside the _src_ folder.

You will receive a red URL FAIL warning if you enter the URL incorrectly, when your internet connection drops, or when you request a bot-blocked site.

If you delete or lose _wkhtmltopdf.exe_ in the _src_ folder, you will get a red MISSING wkhtmltopdf.exe error.

The program will not run when the integrity of the file in the _src_ folder is corrupted.

## What is the difference between the printer and the PDF output?

When you go to any site with your internet browser, the Printer properties are opened with __CTRL + P__ and it is already taken with the save as PDF option. So what's different about this program?

First of all, Microsoft PDF feature takes the image of the site by converting it to pdf. In other words, the texts in the received PDF cannot be copied. They are just images. But with URL2PDF you get the file with its source. Links will be clickable, articles will be copyable. It also gets easier to scale. Its size is smaller than the other.

With Microsoft PDF, you see the Navbars on every page, in-site designs cover the text.

With URL2PDF, you can search for keywords in the content of the pdf files you receive.


### Here you see two sample files:

[Sample of MS Print to PDF](https://github.com/cagatayuresin/URL2PDF/raw/main/docs/Microsoft%20Print%20to%20PDF%20%C3%B6rne%C4%9Fi.pdf) 17.1 MB

[Sample of URL2PDF](https://github.com/cagatayuresin/URL2PDF/raw/main/docs/URL2PDF%20%C3%B6rne%C4%9Fi.pdf) 1.27 MB

As seen in the example, the URL2PDF example, which takes up less than 10 times the space, is also more useful than its competitor.
